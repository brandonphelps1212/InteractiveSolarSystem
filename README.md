# Interactive Solar System Explorer

## Project Overview

The **Interactive Solar System Explorer** is a dynamic OpenGL-based simulation that allows users to navigate through space, observe planetary orbits, and explore a hierarchical animation system of celestial bodies. This project is part of our graphics programming course and demonstrates essential concepts such as camera controls, textured surfaces, and orbital mechanics.

**Note:** For **Assignment 1**, we implemented **hierarchical animations** instead of dynamic lighting.

## Features (Assignment 1)

- **Interactive Camera System**

  - WASD controls for movement
  - Mouse-controlled rotation (pitch and yaw)
  - Vertical movement using Shift/Ctrl

- **Hierarchical Animation**

  - Planets orbiting around the sun
  - Moons orbiting around planets
  - Planetary self-rotation on their axis

- **Textured Surfaces**

  - Realistic textures for the sun, planets, and moons
  - Space skybox with star field

- **Orbital Mechanics**
  - Realistic orbital paths using transformation matrices
  - Scaled speeds for visual clarity

## Controls

- **W/A/S/D:** Move camera forward, left, backward, right
- **Mouse:** Rotate camera view
- **Shift/Ctrl:** Move camera vertically (up/down)
- **Scroll Wheel:** Adjust movement speed
- **ESC:** Exit application
