# 🌌 Interactive Solar System Explorer

## 🚀 Overview

The **Interactive Solar System Explorer** is a real-time, OpenGL-based simulation that allows users to navigate through space, explore planetary orbits, and interact with celestial bodies. Developed across two major parts, it demonstrates core computer graphics concepts including:

- Camera controls
- Hierarchical animation
- Textured surfaces & skyboxes
- Orbital mechanics
- Dynamic lighting & shadows
- Real-time interactivity

This project highlights both **fundamental graphics programming** and **advanced rendering techniques**, making it a strong showcase of OpenGL and C++ development skills.

## ✨ Key Features

### Part 1 — Foundations

- **Interactive Camera System** (WASD + mouse rotation, vertical shift/ctrl movement)
- **Hierarchical Animation** (planetary orbits, moons, and self-rotation)
- **Textured Surfaces & Skybox** (realistic planets, sun, and starfield)
- **Orbital Mechanics** (matrix transformations & scaled orbital speeds)

### Part 2 — Enhancements

- **Dynamic Lighting & Shadows** for realistic scene depth
- **Refined Camera Controls** (smooth zoom, pan, and rotation)
- **Complex 3D Model Integration** (detailed satellite model)
- **HUD System** (real-time display of simulation info)
- **Planet Interactivity** (click planets to reveal info/effects)
- **Time Scale Control** (`[` and `]` keys to slow down or speed up orbits)
- **Visual Upgrades** (high-res textures, improved shading)
- **Asteroid Belt** (dense, animated field for added realism)

## 🎮 Controls

- **W / A / S / D** → Move camera
- **Mouse** → Rotate camera view
- **Shift / Ctrl** → Move vertically (up/down)
- **Scroll Wheel** → Adjust movement speed
- **[ / ]** → Decrease / increase simulation speed
- **ESC** → Exit simulation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **C++**
- **OpenGL**
- **GLFW & GLEW**
- **GLM** (math library for transformations)
- **Shaders** (GLSL for lighting & rendering)
- **Texture Mapping & Skybox Rendering**
