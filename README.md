# Interactive Solar System Explorer

The link to the repository is: https://github.com/brandonphelps1212/InteractiveSolarSystem

## Project Overview

The **Interactive Solar System Explorer** is a dynamic OpenGL-based simulation that allows users to navigate through space, observe planetary orbits, and explore various graphical programming techniques. Across multiple assignments, this project demonstrates concepts such as camera controls, textured surfaces, orbital mechanics, hierarchical animation, dynamic lighting, and interactive elements.

## Features — Assignment 1 (Project 1)

- **Interactive Camera System**
  - WASD controls for movement
  - Mouse-controlled rotation (pitch and yaw)
  - Vertical movement using Shift/Ctrl

- **Hierarchical Animation**
  - Planets orbiting around the sun
  - Moons orbiting around planets
  - Planetary self-rotation on their axis

- **Textured Surfaces**
  - Realistic textures for the sun, planets, and moons
  - Space skybox with star field

- **Orbital Mechanics**
  - Realistic orbital paths using transformation matrices
  - Scaled speeds for visual clarity

> **Note:** For **Assignment 1**, we implemented **hierarchical animations** instead of dynamic lighting.

## Features — Assignment 2 (Project 2)

- **Dynamic Lighting**
  - Realistic light sources to enhance scene depth and realism
  - Improved shading and shadow effects

- **Improved Camera Functions**
  - Enhanced smoothness and responsiveness
  - Better handling for zoom, panning, and rotation

- **Complex 3D Model Integration**
  - Added a fully detailed satellite model into the scene

- **HUD System**
  - On-screen display for relevant simulation information

- **Planet Interactivity**
  - Users can click or interact with planets to trigger information or visual effects

- **Time Scale Control**
  - Adjust simulation speed to speed up or slow down planetary movements

- **Overall Graphics Improvements**
  - Higher-quality textures, refined lighting, and better rendering effects for a more realistic visual experience

- **Asteroid Belt**
  - Added a dense, visually dynamic asteroid belt to enhance realism

## Controls

- **W/A/S/D:** Move camera forward, left, backward, right  
- **Mouse:** Rotate camera view  
- **Shift/Ctrl:** Move camera vertically (up/down)  
- **Scroll Wheel:** Adjust movement speed  
- **[ / ]:** Decrease or increase simulation speed (time scale)  
- **ESC:** Exit application
